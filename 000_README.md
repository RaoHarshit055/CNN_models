📖 Detailed README Description
🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The project demonstrates how CNNs can be applied to recognize visual patterns effectively.

🚀 Features

1.Preprocessing of image dataset (normalization, reshaping).

2.CNN architecture with convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.

3.Training with Adam optimizer & categorical cross-entropy loss.

4.Evaluation on test dataset with accuracy metrics.

5.Visualization of training curves (loss & accuracy).

6.Easy to extend for custom datasets.

🏗️ Model Architecture

1.Conv2D + ReLU Activation

2.MaxPooling2D

3.Dropout (to prevent overfitting)

4.Flatten Layer

5.Dense (Fully Connected Layers)

6.Softmax Output Layer
